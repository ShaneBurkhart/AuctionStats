Auctionstats
========================

Written in rails, AuctionStats.it is a ebay analytics site.  It very simply collects data over the past 30 days, in various categories and gives the user the results.  Various calculations are done but nothing crazy.  Uses the ebay API for all of the data. 

This should not be used by anyone without first asking the creator Shane Burkhart.
